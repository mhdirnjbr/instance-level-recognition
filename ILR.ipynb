Examples include recognizing a specific building, such as Notre Dame, or a specific painting, such as `Starry Night’ by Van Gogh.

An important application is image retrieval - starting from an image of an object of interest (the query), search  through an image dataset to obtain (or retrieve) those images that contain the target object.\n","\n","The goal of this assignment is to experiment and get basic practical experience with the methods that enable specific object recognition. It includes: (i) using SIFT features to obtain sparse matches between two images; (ii) using similarity co-variant detectors to cover changes in viewpoint; (iii) vector quantizing the SIFT descriptors into visual words to enable large scale retrieval; and (iv) constructing and using an image retrieval system to identify objects."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bpW3I6a66Sji"},"source":["# Setup environment\n","\n","We recommend using Google Colab (no GPU required)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yTLfSBZe9QQE"},"source":["## Download and install CyVLFeat"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The new version of Cython in Colab is not compatible with the cyvlfeat libray so we need to downgrade it."],"metadata":{"id":"pptny0IeZEYl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install Cython==3.0.0a9"],"metadata":{"id":"5kkakGfrX0MQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now we can install cyvlfeat."],"metadata":{"id":"CYpaegW2vRec"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"fCDiN_JPo1vD"},"outputs":[],"source":["!wget -N http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/teaching/recvis_orig/assignment1/install_cyvlfeat.py\n","%run install_cyvlfeat.py"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kEcxIyN3O_ME"},"source":["## Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GFGh7fvKZyKT"},"outputs":[],"source":["# nice plot display\n","# uncomment if you are using jupyter lab, requires ipympl: https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib\n","#%matplotlib widget\n","# uncomment if you are using jupyter notebook\n","# %matplotlib notebook\n","\n","import cyvlfeat\n","import numpy as np\n","from skimage.io import imread\n","from skimage.transform import resize, rotate\n","import matplotlib as mpl\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import warnings\n","from cyvlfeat.plot import plotframes\n","from scipy.io import loadmat\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# change some default matplotlib parameters\n","mpl.rcParams['axes.grid'] = False\n","mpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 120\n","\n","# ignore warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wzE1SHZwPCF1"},"source":["## Download and uncompress data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lc-NOqeeAAzN"},"outputs":[],"source":["print('downloading assignment images...')\n","!wget -c http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/teaching/recvis_orig/assignment1/A1_images.tar.gz\n","print('done!')\n","print('uncompressing...')\n","!tar -xzf A1_images.tar.gz\n","print('done!')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SD0WPt9P7kor"},"source":["# Part 1: Sparse features for matching specific objects in images"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Hvi7css7PFQW"},"source":["## Feature point detection\n","\n","The SIFT feature has both a *detector* and a *descriptor*.
